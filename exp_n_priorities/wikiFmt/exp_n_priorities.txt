## Experimentation

### Design
Our experiment will involve first planning out the interior of our innovation as well as the design, which could be solar panels attached to the roofs and the hood of the vehicle, and more importantly, the motor in order to make the vehicle move upon the solar panels being activated with the sunlight.

### Promotions
We would create a Twitter account and post our designs of the vehicle in every tweet we post, as well as a YouTube channel where we post several videos recording our test drives with the car with some volunteers and giving them a survey test drive experience to get more reviews and criticism on the vehicle, and adding features and doing about five test drives on the vehicle when receiving new criticism from the volunteers.

We would repair any damaged parts of the vehicle while test driving. With that, we could explain how the car works by posting and tweeting about updates on the vehicle while creating it, explaining how each part works, as well as ask people what they could like to be added or removed to the product to receive more reviews on the innovation and reach out to customers.

After coming up with a successful product design, we could measure our success and leadership in several quarters with the vehicle by opening several sales on the vehicle along with evaluating how satisfied they are with the design and the feature of the product. We would also provide a survey for the customers for their opinion on the vehicle. This would allow us to test the sales tactics and benchmark. We would then measure how much revenue we received in sales.

### Hypothesis
Our hypothesis is that customers will suggest our product because we come up with multiple designs and functions for each feature of the vehicle, and we are up to date with the progress of creating it.

We can undergo this hypothesis because we do research on how vehicles and solar panels work, and how regular vehicles could contribute to pollution of the environment. With that, we create various plans on the design of our innovation to reduce pollution. We also conduct surveys and questionnaires while experimenting on the vehicle with a volunteer outside the company and reach out to customers on social media.

### Alternate Experiment
Another experiment we would conduct is posting updates on the interior of the car on social media and providing a questionnaire for the common good, and other companies, especially the companies in the environmental industry, to ask them what features they would like to suggest for us to add to or remove from the innovation. With this experiment, we would find out which features would be useful for the customers and the environment's reliability, and it would also be helpful for us to receive more reviews and criticism to improve the vehicle.

## Priorities
To prioritize the features of the product, we would like to test our first experiment with the vehicle with clients outside the Green Mean Machine company, since it would be effective to work with people outside the company to receive feedback and reviews on the innovation, and/or even criticism to improve it. We would also include an "anything else to add" part to the survey for the volunteer to fill out after experimenting on the vehicle with them.
