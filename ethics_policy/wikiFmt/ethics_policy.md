# **Ethics Policy Core Values**

## Safe Work Environment: 
Here at The Green Machine Motors Company, we strive to create a work environment that is safe and welcoming. We value our employees and make that known. Our workers' health is our top priority, and we realize that they are our biggest asset to the company. Any form of sexual harassment will be swiftly corrected. Our employees are required to go through harassment training upon hire. 


## Equality: 
The Green Machine Company is an equal opportunity employer. We pride ourselves on the diversity of our company. This company has a zero-tolerance policy for any discrimination made in the workplace. Our employees undergo diversity training upon hire, and we expect them to uphold this standard set throughout their career with us. 


## Eco-Friendly:
As a green company with a mission to help the environment, we take our recycling seriously. Our employees are required to recycle all their recyclable materials. We are trying to impact the environment positively, and carelessness for recycling does not uphold this standard.

We are a company that depends on learning from its mistakes. All departments work directly with each other to learn from past mistakes to create a safer, more efficient work environment. 

# **Board Members**


## Billy Parish
He is the CEO of Mosaic, which is a crowdfunding platform for solar energy. He worked on clean energy for years after creating the Energy Action Coalition and was referred to as a Climate Hero.
Since the Mosaic company has gathered a majority of public mentions by the press in recent years, I would like to choose the CEO of the solar energy company. His company has planned to install solar panels onto many roofs of houses. He also mentioned to the press that his company offers solar projects as investment opportunities.


## Miles Barr
Barr is the creator of Ubiquitous Energy, which developed ClearView Power technology and allowing the backs of electronic devices and windows to act as solar panels.
We would like to choose Barr for the board since his Ubiquitous Energy product could inspire our solar panel car to transform the back of the car into a solar panel, as well as its windows. It is starting to become an option to have several other surfaces than roofs to generate solar power.


## Steven Chu
Chu is a former United States Secretary of Energy. He was nominated by then-president Obama to be the next secretary of Energy in 2008. He led the project from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory which harnessed solar power as a source of energy for transportation. 
Since Mr. Chu actually had the leadership of the laboratory, it was a center of research for biofuels and solar energy. He also visited the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, in which one of its labs created a solution to convert light into fuels. His leadership in the Helio project in the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory seems to inspire our project for the solar-powered car, as well as his experience with the Joint Center’s solution.


## Eder Holguin
