# Long Term Vision Statement: 

## Goals


1. We want to go and make the planet cleaner and safer by providing solar cars for people in order to reduce pollution 
This started when we were discussing whether we want to start up a company based on video games or on solar cars. After a brief discussion, we decided it was best to do solar cars because we wanted to help our environment
Our purpose is to go and create and produce solar cars that will be available for the public in order to reduce the amount of pollution in our environment 


2. Promote the use of clean green energy while simultaneously reducing the carbon footprint of traditional gas-operated vehicles. Provide a means of transportation capable of transitioning from coast to coast on one single charge. A vehicle that makes traveling affordable, no need to worry about gas stops in the future.


## Inspiration 
This idea came from family. As a child, my parents traveled across the country for work and constantly discussed ways to make their trips more efficient. The idea of a car charged through centripetal force was born. I began to think as I got older, that this in theory could be a great idea yet what will keep the car charged over time when not in use. Surely centripetal force can not be the only means for powering a vehicle. Thus, we decided to incorporate Solar energy. With the latest innovations in solar, all our power needs can be supplied directly from the Planet either through friction or from the sun. This would make our car completely green. 


## Questions in regards to vision statement:

#### What is the impact environmentally of this vehicle?  

The only impact environmentally from the car itself will be the battery. In a study released by the EPA “A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. This assumes the average gasoline vehicle on the road today has a fuel economy of about 22.0 miles per gallon and drives around 11,500 miles per year.” Since our vehicle is gasless we would see a large decline in carbon emissions released into the air reducing the effects of climate change and increasing air quality. 

#### How does the Green Machine plan on dealing with its competitors such as Tesla? 

The Green Machine Motor Company plans to first and foremost patent its revolutionary solar panel design. Once we have this new technology patented, our company will be leading in the distance to charge ratio, making it the most environmentally friendly car. 


## External Opportunities That Exist: 


This includes working with providers to secure influential information and distribution and capitalizing on the ownership of a fast network in the company. There will also be growing market demands with more products with several options which could minimize weaknesses and dissatisfaction from the consumers. 

## Strategy: need at least 3-5 OKRs 

Objectives: 
* To increase recognition for the common good.
* To contribute to innovation for the environmental industry with features for each product designed.
* To prove that our innovation could help the planet earth's environment and reduce pollution and the effects of climate change.
* To contribute to the well-being and physical lives of people using the special features of the innovated products.


Key results: 
* Interview 30 customers per month and get feedback.
* Invite 40 customers to experiment with innovation.
* Plan out 10 experimentation methods.
* Plan out at least 5 innovation designs.
* Receive 25 reviews from customers after experimentation.
