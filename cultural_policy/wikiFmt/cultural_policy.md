## **Core Values & Motivations**
Innovation is at the heart of our company. We pride ourselves in being innovative to contribute to the global economy as well as the environment. We fear falling behind as a result of a set of
misaligned values.
We believe it is important to encourage diversity in the workplace to facilitate for new -- diverse ideas. In order to deliver innovative ideas, we believe that we should hold each other responsible to make consistent decisions and commit to them personally. This allows us to work freely and more effectively. Furthermore, we believe it is important to allow for flexibility in the workplace -- to allow people to work where they thrive. In order to benefit from the strengths and experience of employees of different ages, we have extensive programs for flexible and mobile working.
We believe that by being diverse, we are able to move quickly to adapt to new environments.
We have a long-term goal of CO2 reduction. Green Tech has set a target for 2050 of reducing new-car CO2 emissions by 90%, compared to the year 2000 levels. Green Machine is committed to providing a compelling vehicle while reducing carbon emissions.
