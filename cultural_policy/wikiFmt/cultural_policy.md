## **Motivations**
Innovation is at the heart of our company. We pride ourselves in being innovative to contribute to the global economy as well as the environment.
We fear falling behind as a result of a lack of diversity in ideas and believe a homogenous environment does not promote
creativity; thus, we believe it is important to encourage diversity in the workplace to stimulate new -- diverse ideas.
Furthermore, we believe it is important to allow for flexibility in the workplace -- to allow people to work where they thrive. In order to benefit from the strengths and experience of employees of different ages, we have extensive programs for flexible and mobile working.
We believe that by being diverse, we are able to move quickly to adapt to new environments.
